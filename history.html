                been a dream for Dr. Seri Intan Idayu to have her own tuition that teach high-school students.

                <h2>2020</h2>
                <p> The world then got hit by Covid Virus. The Malaysian government issued an order called Movement Control Order or 
                    known among malaysian as Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan (PKP). The business could not run at all. People are scared 
                    to get infected by the virus as it can lead to death.

                <p> After endless online discussion and meeting, these 5 people has observed that by hosting an online tuition class can 
                    help in running back the business. There are 2 batch of high-school students that need to sit for SPM which is batch
                    2003 & 2004. We then started trial online tuition for 1 week to these students and it received a lot of supports.
